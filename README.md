# Automated analysis of the financial markets

This Jupyter notebook enables the user to perform an automated stock market analysis for the __sector__ or __sub-sector__ of interest. 
The assessment is made against the performance of each stock at the beginning of the year, 2020, and has been developed to assess the impact on COVID-19 on each sector of the financial markets.

The user can either perform an high level analysis to assess the year to date performance of the whole S&P 500, or can go more in depth and assess the performance of each sub-sector.

Thank you.
